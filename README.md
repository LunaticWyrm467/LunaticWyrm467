### HELLO WORLD!

I'm Niko (or Nik, whichever name works for ya!), and I am a freeloader that is currently preparing to move overseas to study at a CS-focused Uni in Germany!
I love working on personal coding projects and games, and some of my interests include the following:
- 🎮 Game Development
- 🤖 Artifical Intelligence
- 💾 Low-Level Programming

I have a variety of languages that I am interested in, and here are some that I am either familiar with, learning, or have worked with in the past:
- 📒 Javascript (It's been a while)
- ☕ Java
- 💙 C
- ➕ C++
- #️⃣ C#
- 🔷 F#
- 🐍 Python
- ⚙️ GDScript
- 🔵 Lua

Most of my personal project's repos are privated, but I might be working on open-source programs in the future!
